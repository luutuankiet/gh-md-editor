description: Where behaviour lives in this repo — a per-area map of which files and line ranges own what, so you can open the right file instead of searching for it. Use before hunting for where something is implemented, before adding a feature that touches existing behaviour, and when a change seems to need edits in more places than expected.

# Where things live

This repo is large enough that finding the right file costs more than reading it.
The pages below are maps: for each area, which files own it and roughly where in
them.

**Pick the area, open that one page, then go straight to the file.** Do not read
every page — that defeats the point.

## Where things live

One page per area of the system. Read before going looking for where
something is implemented.

| page | covers | verified |
|---|---|---|
| [Release and delivery](../../../docs/architecture/release-and-delivery.md) | which manifest publishes what, what a v* tag triggers, and how a running server upgrades itself | 2026-08-20 |
| [The server HTTP surface](../../../docs/architecture/server-http-surface.md) | where an API handler lives in server/index.mjs, how paths are made safe, and how symlinks are classified | 2026-08-20 |
| [Source-line mapping and reveal-counterpart](../../../docs/architecture/source-line-mapping.md) | how a preview element knows which markdown line produced it, and why the panes do not scroll together | 2026-08-20 |
| [Tab lifecycle and per-tab view state](../../../docs/architecture/tab-lifecycle-and-view-state.md) | why state kept in a tab component disappears when you switch tabs, and where to put it instead | 2026-08-20 |
| [Two shells, one source tree](../../../docs/architecture/two-shells-one-repo.md) | which components belong to the browser editor, which to the server IDE, and why a change in src/lib touches both | 2026-08-20 |

The same table, browsable, is [docs/README.md](../../../docs/README.md).

## How to read a line range

Every entry is `file — lines — what lives there`. **The line numbers are a
starting point, not an address.** They drift with every commit that touches the
file above them, and nothing regenerates them.

So: jump to roughly that line, then confirm you are in the right place by what the
code says, not by the number. If a range is off by more than a screen or two, fix
it in the page and re-date it — that is a one-line edit and it is how the map
stays worth having.

Line ranges are given at all because the files that matter most here are big:
`server/index.mjs` is 3,719 lines and holds the entire HTTP surface, and `src/components/App-server.svelte` and `src/components/server/CodeTab.svelte` are each around 100 KB. "It's in `server/index.mjs`" is not an answer. Grep the handler or symbol
name first, then read the range around it — never read those three whole.

## What this map does not tell you

It tells you **where**, not **why it is dangerous**. Several of the areas below
have failure modes that produce no error message. Those are catalogued
separately, by symptom, in the `repo-maintenance` skill and in
[docs/README.md](../../../docs/README.md). If you are about to change shared state
or anything on the per-tab view state in `src/lib/tab-view-state.svelte.ts`, or the session snapshot and restore pair in `src/components/App-server.svelte`, look there first.

## Keeping it accurate

A map that lies is worse than none, because it sends people confidently to the
wrong file. Two habits keep it honest:

- **Re-date what you touch.** If you worked in an area and the page was right,
  bump `verified:`. If it was wrong, fix it and bump.
- **Add an area when you create one, not later.** A new subsystem with no page is
  invisible; the next person re-derives its shape from scratch.

To add a page, follow the same rules as any other doc — see the `repo-maintenance`
skill. Frontmatter for an area page is `title`, `covers` (what someone would be
looking for, phrased as they would phrase it), and `verified`. Then run
`bash scripts/gen-docs-index.sh`; the block above is generated and hand edits to it
are overwritten.
